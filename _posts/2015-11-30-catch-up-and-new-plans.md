Last week I delivered a course on Software Engineering to a group of 25 17-18 year-olds. The course was a week long and over the week the students were asked to create their own blog and to write up blog posts on what they were learning. You can read a little more about it in my [previous post](/2015/11/23/cs_and_se_at_vp/).

One of the very obvious questions I was asked was "do you have a blog?". Well... I do, but I've not been very good at writing entries. To remedy that, I wrote up the post on what the course was all about. I then resolved to renew my resolution on writing posts.

I started this incarnation of my blog in January 2015. I created the site and added a section for projects that I was working on. My plan at the time was to try to tidy up the huge collection of half-started ideas and projects that I had. I wanted to work on each one for a month and get it into an MVP form. I didn't keep up with this resolution either.

I have now updated my projects page with a bit of information on each of the things I'm working on in my spare time. I'm not going to try to put a deadline on each of these projects as I did before. I _am_ going to try to keep this blog updated with the stuff I'm working on.

Today I've done a bit of a sweep of the site and tidied up some cobwebs. Tomorrow I'm going write up a post on Vantage, the biggest spare-time sink I've got at the moment.
