Things that I've found annoying

- auto add to git repo by default
- multiple cursors?
- alt and right moves cursor over the space on the right hand side
- can't soft wrap at a column?
- correcting a spelling takes way too many clicks (classic IDE problem, IMO)
- so many buttons!
- vagrant integration doesn't allow for interactivity during vagrant up (e.g. for hostsupdater)
