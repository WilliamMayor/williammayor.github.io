Welcome to my website, I'm William Mayor, I'm a software engineer currently working for [BAFTA Research](https://www.bafta.org/initiatives/commercial/research) and [Diversity and Ability](https://www.dnamatters.co.uk). I'm primarily a Python developer and the majority of my work has been in web programming. I'm self-employed and based in London, UK.

I'm using this site for my [blog](/blog/) where I'll try to write about the things I'm learning. My [projects page](/projects/) details the things I'm building in my spare time.

Feel free to contact me, my details are in the top right.
