OK, wow.

It's been nearly a year since I wrote my [previous blog post](/blog/2015/11/23/catch_up_and_new_plans/). In it I said that it was hypocritical of me not to write a blog, given that I teach a course that highlights the importance of doing so. I then proceeded to write 3 drafts posts that never made it past the draft stage.

Very recently I listened to an [interesting podcast](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog) on the topic of writing a programming. This has spurred me on to get my act together and actually write something. The podcast was a Talk Python to Me interview with A. Jesse Davis who gave a talk at PyCon 2016 called ["Write an Excellent Programming Blog"](https://emptysqua.re/blog/the-write-an-excellent-programming-blog-page/).

So here are my new new plans. I'm going to write some blog posts using the 5 design patterns that Jesse lays out. I'm also going to keep my previous posts here to embarrass me into sticking to my new plans.
