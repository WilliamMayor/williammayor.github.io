This is the first in what will be a series of posts where I evaluate the [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) software offerings during their 30-day free trial.

JetBrains are a company that make software for software developers. They make lots of Integrated Developer Environments (IDEs) specialising in specific languages. I think they became famous/popular originally for their [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?fromMenu) Java IDE.

Over the past couple of months I have seen and heard many people extolling the virtues of the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) IDE. An IDE for Python development. This has piqued my interest enough to get me to download it (and others) and see what all the fuss is about.

## Thoughts Going In

I haven't used an IDE since my early uni days. We were taught Java and so were introduced to the BlueJay, Netbeans, and Eclipse IDEs. I'm sure there were more but those are the ones that stand out in my memory. I remember finding it confusing and overwhelming. The quantity of buttons and options available in these software was so great that I'm sure it made it harder to learn how to program.

During my Masters I discovered Python and absolutely fell in love. Java was a temperamental mistress and I found the idea of not having to write `private static final int` et al very freeing. Another thing that was freeing? It seemed perfectly acceptable (and possible) to write Python code without a whooping great IDE to help you along. You could just use a text editor if you wanted. Wonderful!

I downloaded a free, clean, simple text editor ([Smultron](https://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/), no longer free) and got to work. I had to learn to use the Terminal and other tools, but nothing was as complicated as booting up Eclipse for the first time.

It's been several years since those days and I've only ever booted up an IDE when I needed to do something with Android/iOS development. I've never thought I was missing out by not using a Python IDE. But everyone is raving so much about PyCharm recently; type hints, inline docs, auto complete, smart linting, etc. etc.

It's time to dive back in

## The Plan

I've downloaded the following bits of software:

- PyCharm
- WebStorm (where I'm writing this post)
- PHPStorm
- DataGrip

They each come with a 30-day free trial so for the next 30 days I'm going to use nothing but these tools (or other JetBrains software) to get my coding done. I'll allow myself the odd `vim .bash_profile` for those little jobs, but no Atom, no Sublime, and no Visual Studio Code.

I am probably going to use [SourceTree ](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for my git needs. I'm already a little annoyed by how WebStorm seems to be adding things to my repo, automatically and in the background. Plus, I've got used to how SourceTree works and I don't want to mess with a good thing (especially involving git).

I've got 30 days to work out if I love IDEs (and should start paying for them), or if I was right before and IDEs are too complicated for me to handle.

Wish me luck.
