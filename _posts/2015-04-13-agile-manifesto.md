I have been advised to read the agile manifesto. I want to get into agile programming as a day-to-day thing. So far in my career I've worked largely alone (always as the sole developer anyway) and agile methodologies that I've half-learned seem a poor fit. I'm going to read the manifesto now (before your very eyes) and comment on what I read. I'm looking for things that strike me as being good ideas, things that solve problems I've encountered in the past, and things that I can actually use in my work.

Here goes...

...

Let's start with what seem like the four main principles:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

I'm not sure about this as an abstract statement. The two sides seem like quite different things. I think that what it's saying is: prefer human interaction over pre-defined systems for solving problems? So meet up with a client and talk about issues, rather than create bug tickets? Pair-programming over code review?

I'm not sure where tools fall into this. Individuals over tools? Always hire a person when a tool could do the job? That seems crazy. Interactions over tools? I don't understand what that could mean... don't use Skype?

> Working software over comprehensive documentation

I can see the business value of this statement and I've certainly fallen into the trap of too rigorously documenting code and processes that inevitably change. The word 'comprehensive' seems to be there as a negative adjective, the statement seems to be saying "don't waste time on over-documenting work you've done when there's still work to do". Surely the issue here is in over-documenting? Shouldn't the goal of software engineering be to create working software that's also adequately documented? I don't think they're suggesting that you should hand poorly documented but working code to a client. So shouldn't the principle be "Sufficient documentation over comprehensive"? It reminds of when people say "don't eat too much X", of course you shouldn't, that's the definition of 'too much'.

> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

This one I really like. I've always shied away from lengthy contracts and stories of contract disputes and painful clients make me quite nervous about new projects. Because of this, I've always gone down an "ask me and we'll work it out together" kind of route. I think it's served me well and now I know it's recommended.

> Responding to change over following a plan

This I think comes out of a software engineering environment found in large companies where change is hard and paperwork is many. Perhaps it's because agile methodologies have always been around and talked about during my career that I think this is kind of a standard. I tend to work from very broad brush stroke plans of future functionality and then work iteratively towards that goal. As ideas take shape and things form the client and I can guide progress in whatever direction is needed.

OK, that's the four main points, now I'm into the 12 principles. Here's my boiled down understanding:

- Continually deliver software that evolves out of strong communication between developers and other interested parties
- Management of developers should be quite hands-off

I like that the principles call for self-reflection, self-improvement and 'technical excellence'. It's comforting (and perhaps falls into my confirmation-bias) that they don't recommend hands-on management but instead good conversations.

I haven't worked as part of a larger development team and so some of the points seem to effect me less:

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

So far I've been a self-organising team of one so I'm not sure if there's a take-home for me there.

## Conclusion

I think the agile manifesto came out and had such a large impact on software engineering that when I read it I think "well, obviously". I think I'm already quite agile (for a single person team).

There are guiding principles in the manifesto but no practical advice given. I'm going to explore in detail the idea of Scrum and XP next, I think they'll give me the practical guidance that I thought I might find here.
