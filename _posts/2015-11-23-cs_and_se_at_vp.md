OK... so I've been a bit lax about writing on this blog. That's a bit hypocritical given that I'm currently delivering a course that centres around how great it is for developers to write blogs.

So I'm going to kick start my blog writing with a quick run-down of the Computer Science and Software Engineering Course I'm currently helping to run at Villiers Park. CS and SE at VP.

The course is put on for a gifted and talented range of sixth-form students from around the UK. They pick from a list of possible courses and these particulars fools chose the Computer Science one. I'm running the software engineering side of things. I'm focusing on broad SE practises that I've boiled down in my own way to be; problem solving and being lazy. You can read over the slides for my talks here: [http://wm.codeguild.co].

In the talks I explain that SE requires two skills. Problem solving is the art of breaking a large task down into smaller, manageable chunks. I talk about how breaking problems down like this is quite natural but that software engineers try to be very exact a precise about it. I don't quite venture into the world of Kanban, Agile, and issue trackers but I try to explain the importance of being able to describe a project in terms of small units of work.

In the being lazy part of the talk I describe principles like DRY and KISS. I talk about how to do an excellent job with the least amount of effort. I think that thinking like this leads to a conclusion that aligns with industry best practise. You write decent documentation because you don't want to spend time in the future re-reading all of your code, but you don't write docs that describe the code (because the code does that itself and you're two lazy to write functions twice).

I'm sure my explanation of SE in these terms is a little simplistic, and probably misses out a lot of important factors. I'd like to think it's a good stepping stone, and hopefully something that isn't really covered in A-level syllabuses.

I like running these course because they give me an opportunity to try to distill what I'm learning about SE and deliver it to a room of A-level students. The course gets better (IMO) each time I run it; a combination of me learning more about SE and me learning more about delivering courses.
